# Alex Brown
**`Aspiring Data Scientist`**

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a 4<sup>th</sup> year Data Science major at SFU. I'm currently looking for a Summer co-op position. If you're an employer who has landed here feel free to peruse my projects. A lot of my university projects and personal work were done off of GitHub so this is by no means a complete reflection of my work. That being the two projects showcased in the links below do have their repositories on here, so check that out.

## What Interests Me?

Sectors I can see myself working in long-term:
  * Agriculture
  * Business Analytics
  * Fintech
  * Research
  
That's not an exhaustive list. I love all things data, and I'm sure there are many industries and fields I haven't properly considered that would be a great fit for me.

Hobbies:
  * Coding!
  * Bouldering
  * Hiking
  * Puzzles

I'm an avid boulderer and I'm also very interested in how data science can be used to study and improve climbing performance. I love the work the people at [Lattice](https://latticetraining.com/) have done, and would be very interested on lending my skills to similar projects. If you know of any that are looking for coders/data scientists let me know.
